# React Native Task Manager App

## Description

This is a task manager application built using React Native. It allows users to organize their tasks into different categories and track ongoing tasks.

## Components Usage

### View
The `View` component is used to structure and layout the user interface. It acts as a container for other components, providing a way to group and arrange them on the screen.

### Text
The `Text` component is used to display text content in the application. It supports styling and formatting options such as font size, color, and alignment.

### ScrollView
The `ScrollView` component is used to create a scrollable container for content that exceeds the available screen space. It enables users to scroll through long lists or view content that doesn't fit entirely on the screen.

### TextInput
The `TextInput` component is used to capture user input, such as text or numerical data. It provides an interface for users to enter and edit information via the keyboard.

### Stylesheet
The `Stylesheet` module is used to define styles for components in the application. It allows developers to create reusable styles and apply them to various components using JavaScript objects.

### Button
The `Button` component is used to create interactive buttons that trigger actions or events when pressed by the user. It can be customized with text, color, and onPress callback function.

### FlatList / SectionList
The `FlatList` and `SectionList` components are used to render lists of data in the application. They efficiently display large datasets by only rendering the items that are currently visible on the screen.
